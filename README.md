🔥 SEGFAULT: The Code Whisperer Engine 🔥A full-stack, AI-powered competitive programming platform designed for mastery, efficiency, and real-time grading.This project delivers an enterprise-grade experience for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice, featuring a secure Express.js backend with integrated code execution and a dynamic React/Redux frontend with a personalized Gemini AI Tutor.🌟 Key FeaturesFeatureDescriptionStack ComponentsReal-Time Code GradingInstant submission grading against hidden test cases using an integrated Judge0-like API utility. Provides precise runtime and memory metrics.Backend: userSubmission.js, problemUtility.jsGemini AI TutorA dedicated, context-aware AI chat (powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash) integrated into the IDE. It acts strictly as a DSA expert, offering hints, code review, and complexity analysis.Frontend: ChatAi.jsx   Backend: solveDoubt.jsSecure AuthenticationRobust security featuring JWT-based sessions, password hashing via bcrypt, and Redis blacklisting for instant token invalidation upon logout.Backend: userAuthent.js, redis.js, userMiddleware.jsAdmin Content ManagementAdmin-gated modules for full CRUD operations on problems, including pre-deployment reference solution validation and dedicated video solution management.Frontend: AdminPanel.jsx, AdminVideo.jsx   Backend: userProblem.jsIntegrated IDE & UIA sleek, responsive user interface (built with DaisyUI/Tailwind) featuring the Monaco Editor, a customizable layout, and an integrated submission history viewer.Frontend: ProblemPage.jsxVideo Editorial SolutionsSecure video solution streaming via Cloudinary, managed end-to-end through the Admin panel.Backend: videoSection.js   Frontend: Editorial.jsx⚙️ Full-Stack Architecture1. ⚛️ Frontend (/frontend/src)The application layer built on modern standards for performance and user experience.ComponentTechnologyRole & State ManagementFrameworkReact (Vite)Main application rendering and routing (App.jsx, main.jsx).StylingTailwind CSS + DaisyUIHighly responsive, component-based styling (index.css).State Mgmt.Redux ToolkitCentralized, secure state management for authentication (authSlice.js).Form HandlingReact Hook Form + ZodValidation and handling for all forms (Login, Signup, Admin Panel).IDEMonaco EditorThe in-browser code editor used in ProblemPage.jsx.2. 🟢 Backend (/backend/src)The core engine responsible for data, security, and external API communication.ComponentTechnologyRoleAPIExpress.js (Node.js)Routing, Middleware, and CORS management (index.js).DatabaseMongoDB (Mongoose)Data modeling for Users, Problems, Submissions, and Videos.Caching/SecurityRedis ClientCaching for token blacklisting (logout security).Code ExecutionJudge0 API UtilityHandles batch submission and result fetching (problemUtility.js).AIGoogle GenAI SDKPowers the DSA tutor (solveDoubt.js).CloudCloudinary v2Manages video uploads, signatures, and hosting (videoSection.js).🔑 Security & Authorization FlowAuthentication: User signs up (Signup.jsx), passing data to POST /user/register. Data is validated (Zod/Mongoose), password is bcrypt hashed, and a JWT is issued as an HttpOnly cookie.Authorization: All protected routes use userMiddleware.js or adminMiddleware.js.The middleware verifies the JWT signature and checks the user's role.It checks the Redis client to ensure the token has NOT been blacklisted (preventing logged-out access).Logout: Hitting POST /user/logout sends the current JWT to Redis, blacklisting it based on its expiry time, and clears the cookie—guaranteeing immediate session termination.🚀 Quick Start (Configuration)Before running the backend, ensure your .env file contains the necessary secrets:PORT=3000
